The demo code focuses on splitting log files into individual parts and creating a data-structured matrix from them.
Rules for defining individual log segments are encoded in the package, and the rules are based on the source files available in this repository:
https://github.com/logpai/loghub/tree/master

Usage example:
log_parser('openstack_normal2.log')
